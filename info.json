"description":"First DeSci project on GOSH (https://gosh.sh/) blockchain. Jocelyn has in mind to do three simple things: review your study plan, give you a fund and accept your research results. You would be able to get DAO's governance tokens from each voter and use it as a primary reimbursement of your research expenses with possibility to increase it further. You'll get a reward for both significant & non-significant results being accepted by the Jocelyn members. Moreover, Jocelyn has founded it reasonable to build-up ontologies above the DAO - to show the interplay of all objects inside, analyse it and predict the value of all it is doing.",
